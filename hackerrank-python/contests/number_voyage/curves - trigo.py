"""
by drawing mod sin and mod cos graphs,we see that for 0 < theta < 2 pi :
area = 8 * integral( 0 to pi/4 cos x dx)
which equates to 4 * underroot 2

Problem Statement

Professor Math draws graph of two curves |sin(x)| and |cos(x)|.
For 0≤x≤2π, the area of the region enclosed by max(|sin(x)|,|cos(x)|)
is written as cc21c3−−√. If c1, c2 and c3 are prime
numbers, find the value of c1×c2×c3.
